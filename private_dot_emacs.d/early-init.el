;;; Commentary:

;; Prior to Emacs 27, the `init.el' was supposed to handle the
;; initialisation of the package manager, by means of calling
;; `package-initialize'.  Starting with Emacs 27, the default
;; behaviour is to start the package manager before loading the init
;; file.  This can create unexpected results with existing
;; configuration files.  I prefer the old behaviour so I defer the
;; process to `init.el'.

;;; Code:

;; Do not initialise the package manager.  This is done in `init.el'.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Allow loading from the package cache.
(setq package-quickstart t)

;; Do not resize the frame at this early stage.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;;; early-init.el ends here
